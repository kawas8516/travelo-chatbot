# Travelo - Museum Ticketing Chatbot

Travelo is a chatbot-based ticketing system for museums. It provides a convenient way for users to book, cancel, and reschedule museum tickets, as well as get museum information such as location and amenities. The chatbot uses a Large Language Model (LLM) for dynamic responses to user queries and integrates with MongoDB for ticket management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python** (>= 3.8)
- **MongoDB** for ticket data storage. You can use a local MongoDB instance or MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based solution.
- **Node.js** and **npm** (if using frontend frameworks that require them)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/travelo.git
    cd travelo
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up MongoDB**:
    - Ensure MongoDB is running on your system.
    - You can use the MongoDB Compass or the MongoDB shell to create the database and collection.
    - Create a new database named `museum_ticketing_system` and a collection named `museum_info` and `ticket_info` .
    - For cloud setup, create a MongoDB Atlas account, create a database cluster, and note down the connection URI.(by deault it's localhost)

5. **Add Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
      ```plaintext
      MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your_mongo_uri
      DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
      HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token
      ```

### Tokens Required

- **Hugging Face Token**: For LLM integration, sign up for a Hugging Face account, create an API token, and add it to your `.env` file as shown above.
- **Django Secret Key**: Generate a secret key for Django (you can use a tool like `https://djecrety.ir/` to create one) and add it to `.env`.

## Running the Project

1. **Start the Django Server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2. **Access the Application**:
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the chatbot interface.

3. **Using API Endpoints**:
    - You can access various endpoints like booking, canceling, and rescheduling tickets. Check the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) section for more details.
